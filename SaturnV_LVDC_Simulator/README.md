# Saturn V LVDC Simulator

## Overview
A clear, modular, cycle-accurate simulation of the Saturn V Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) hardware. This project aims to replicate the internal architecture of the LVDC including 26-bit word length (simulated), 32K memory, registers, and instruction set, running on modern Windows hardware.

## Project Structure
- `src/lvdc_hardware/`: Core hardware simulation (Registers, Memory, Clock).
- `src/control_software/`: Flight software (Guidance, Navigation).
- `src/ui/`: User interfaces (CLI and C# GUI).
- `docs/`: Design documents and logs.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
